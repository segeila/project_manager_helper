Espoo Karage is a new space for all Nokia employees. They can learn and practice new skills and technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning and data analysis. Working stations, various sensors and cameras are provided for a free and unlimited use. The use of Karage will be analyzed using low resolution thermal and digital cameras, feedback system based on IBM Watson sentimental analysis module. Convolutional neural networks will be applied to images from cameras for object detection, image segmentation and image processing. Data extracted from video stream is used to make prediction about utilization of the space in upcoming days. Time series are analied using RNN and linear regression models. Accuracy of these models is compared based on ROC AUC and cross enthropy. Results of this analysis will be presented to the manager of the Karage so he can access how successful this project is and what improvements can be made.
